# user-journey-webtraffic-analysis

This SQL query is designed to analyze user journeys on a website using Google Analytics 4 (GA4) data. The objective is to identify the common user journeys, such as users coming from 'google / organic' or 'facebook / instagram' traffic, and calculate the percentage of sessions for each journey.

The query consists of several parts:

first_five_pages CTE (Common Table Expression): This CTE processes the raw GA4 data and extracts the first five pages visited by users in each session, along with their engagement time in milliseconds (used as a proxy for hitNumber) and the source_medium information. It is important to note that using engagement_time_msec as a proxy for hitNumber may not provide a perfect representation of the sequence of interactions, but it serves as a viable workaround.

FILTER CTE: This CTE filters the data from the first_five_pages CTE, selecting only the rows where hitNumber is 1 (i.e., the first interaction) and source_medium contains 'google / organic'. This helps focus the analysis on the target audience.

Main query: The main query aggregates the data from the FILTER CTE, grouping by the first five pages visited in each session. It then calculates the count of sessions and the percentage of sessions for each journey. The results are sorted in descending order by the number of sessions.

By using this query, you can gain insights into the most common user journeys for visitors coming from different traffic sources (e.g. Google/Facebook, etc.), which can help inform your website optimization efforts and marketing strategies.
